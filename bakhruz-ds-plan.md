### Data Science Learning Plan

#### General Comments on Filling Out the Table
1. In each cell, assign values from 0 to 10. The value reflects your self-assessed level of competency in a given area. In some cases, the assessment is subjective, while in others, specific criteria will be provided.
2. The table includes several areas of development (rows highlighted in gray). Do not assign values to these rows. Values should only be entered in the subpoints, which will then be automatically aggregated using a formula.
3. If you need to add comments about your assessment, use comments on specific cells.
